    <h1>Global errors demo</h1>

    <p>This page gives an example of global embed errors. The first embed below
       has a <code>src</code> that does not match the origin of the page
       (<code>http://localhost:8081</code>, by default). This error displays in
       the first embed, and carries over to the one beneath it.</p>

    <script src='http://localhost:8081/modules/embed/v1/embed.js'></script>
    <cb-embed
      src='http://other:8081/sample/modules/embed/v1/resource/example/1'>
    </cb-embed>

    <p>This embed's has two errors. The first is global: it, too, does not match
       the page's origin. The second is local to this embed only; its
       <code>src</code> is for a deployment of CB other than the one specified
       by the <code>src</code> of the first embed on the page. All embeds in a
       single page must be from one CB deployment.</p>

    <script src='http://localhost:8081/modules/embed/v1/embed.js'></script>
    <cb-embed
      src='http://localhost:8082/sample/modules/embed/v1/resource/example/2'>
    </cb-embed>
