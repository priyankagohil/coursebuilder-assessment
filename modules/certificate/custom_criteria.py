"""File specifying custom certificate criteria functions.

Course authors may specify custom criteria for award of a certificate.
In order to be invoked, all of the following must all apply:
  * The function name is specified as a custom_criteria field
    in the certificate_criteria group of course.yaml.
  * The function name is added to the registration_table whitelist below.
  * The function is defined in this module.
The arguments and return type of the function are described in
example_custom_criterion below.
